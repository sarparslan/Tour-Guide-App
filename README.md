# Tour-Guide-App
You are a tour guide in a coastal city and you need to organize a ship tour for your guests.
There are N islands around the city and M undirected paths between the islands. The ship tour you
will organize should start from island X and include island Y and return the beginning point at the
end of the tour.
In the input, the first line contains 2 space separated integers, N, M. N denotes the number
of islands we have, M denotes the number of connections between the N islands. Next M lines
contains two space separated integers each, U and V denoting that there is a bidirectional road
between island U and island V. Next line contains two space separated integers, X the island we
start tour and Y the island tour should include.

In the first line it is given that we have 6 islands and 6 bidirectional paths between them.
The next lines gives the connections between the islands and the last line gives which island is the
starting point and which island should be included to the tour for this case.
